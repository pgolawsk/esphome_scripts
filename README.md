# esphome_scripts

My configuration scripts for esp and similar devices within my home network, including multiple sensors, switches.

This repository contains YAML scripts for configuration of ESP devices (includes esp8266, esp32, bk7231n).

For inventory of components and particular configurations see [Inventory.md](Inventory.md).

## Futures

- This is modular repository, which means that sensors, manipulators, ... are embedded into particular device script via `!include <file>` statements. Usually those are single line includes.
- Those includes may define or override variables, which make particular configuration. For example for `i2c.yaml` variables given define GPIO pins (SDA, SCL) which are serve as I2C interface.
- Always available components:
  - Wifi
  - OTA (Over The Air) updates
  - MQTT publish sensor values, like `esp-xx/temperature`
  - Additional MQTT topic for sensors with friendly structure, like `home/office/temperature`
  - Logger via MQTT
  - Prometheus, exposing `/metrics` web interface endpoint
  - HomeAssistant API
  - Web server
  - Time (via SNTP)
  - Logger with `I` (`INFO`) level via API, web, MQTT
  - No USB logs output by default (as most devices are not connected to any USB)
- Optional components:
  - Sun (to provide elevation, azimuth and sunrise sunset times)
  - RTTTL - to play RTTTL melody via passive buzzer; melody can be received via MQTT (`esp-xx/play_rtttl` topic)
  - Logger LEVEL + USB output
  - Other WiFi networks credentials
  - API services

## Script names

Script filenames reflect what sensors, switches and manipulators are included in particular one. The naming convention is `board_MMmm_SSss__PP.yaml`, where:

- `board` is the type of ESP board/device, like `esp12f` or `esp32c3`, ...
- `MM` are the MEASURES provided, like temperature, humidity, ...
- `mm` are the manipulators used, like diode, rtttl, ...
- `SS` are the SENSORS used, like SHT30, BH1750, ...
- `ss` are the switches used, like buzzer, AVT5713 board, ...
- `PP` is PURPOSE of the device, like fan or gate;

> Info:  Scripts which ends `_dev` do contain many sensors/includes - if you need any other configuration you can see there how to build it with `!include <file>` statements.

For example: `esp12f_THIddb_STr.yaml` script is for:

- board:
  - `esp12f` - ESP12-F board
- measures:
  - `T` - Temperature
  - `H` - Humidity
  - `I` - Illuminance
- manipulators:
  - `d` - diode
  - `d` - diode (2nd one)
  - `b` - buzzer
- sensors:
  - `S` - SHT30 - temperature and humidity
  - `T` - TCS3472 - illuminance and temperature color
- switches:
  - `r` - RTTTL

## Usage

### Requirements

You need to have

- `python3` installed, in minimum version `3.10`
- `esphome` command installed, in minimum version `2023.02`.

### Installation

Short instruction:

- To install please use following: `pip3 install esphome`
- To install upgrade use following: `pip3 install -U esphome`

To see full installation procedure please follow `esp_setup.sh` file and run specific commands. DO NOT RUN this script at once. The file includes:

- MQTT configuration, especially ACL
- Prometheus configuration
  - Example Grafana dashboard to display data from Prometheus is in `Home Sensors-Grafana4Prometheus_dashboard.json` file
- `esphome` commands to flash specific configurations

### Example ESP device flashing command

Before running it please:

- Copy `secrets_example.yaml` script into `secrets.yaml` and modify values for secret variables, like WiFi password
- Review the script actions. See `esp12_dev.yaml` as example as it contains almost all available configurations with `!include <file>` files parameters. For full list of include file parameters please see inside specific include file.

#### Sample command

`esphome -s devicename esp12f_office -s updates 30s -s room Office -s mqtt_room office run esp12f_THIddb_STr.yaml`

To trigger only OTA update for particular IP please add `--device 192.168.x.x` at the end of above command.

##### Command parameters

The parameters are following `-s` argument. Those are:

- `devicename` - the name of the device, `esp-xx` is default
- `updates` - how frequently sensors are updated, `30s` is default
- `room` - friendly name of the room, `Room` is default
- `mqtt_location` - name of the location for MQTT, `home` is default
- `mqtt_room` - name of the room for MQTT, `room` is default

Some scripts which have sensors or manipulators in 2 areas have the parameters for 2nd area passed as:

- `room2` - friendly name of the room, `none` is default
- `mqtt_location2` - name of the location for MQTT, `none` is default
- `mqtt_room2` - name of the room for MQTT, `none` is default
