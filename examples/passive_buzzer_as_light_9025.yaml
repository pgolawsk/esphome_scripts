#* Passive buzzer connected to GPIO
# Pawelo, 20221127, created as new based on https://diyi0t.com/active-passive-buzzer-arduino-esp8266-esp32/
# Pawelo, 20221215, added beep 3 times sortly, based on: https://help.konnected.io/support/solutions/articles/32000030295-esphome-binary-sensors-switches-sensor-configuration
# Pawelo, 20221223, passive buzzer good example: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/esphome-and-passive-buzzer-continuous-beep-sound/477046/2
# Pawelo, 20230128, re-wired besed on BC848 datasheet https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/data-sheet/BC848_SER.pdf
#                    see also for example: https://esphome.io/components/rtttl.html?highlight=rtttl

# need passive buzzer 9025, diode 1N4001/1N4007, transistor BC848 and resistor 220Ohm (?)
