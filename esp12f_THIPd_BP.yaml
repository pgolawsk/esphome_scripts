#* ESP12F sensor board script name reflecting configuration esp12f_MMmm_SSss__PP.yaml
#* Please read README.md for details
#* For pinout see: file://.//pinouts/ESP_12E_pinout.png
# NOTE: pin 9 do not work (it hangs ESP)- reserved for flashing;
# NOTE: pin 10 - use with caution, read https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1462

# Pawelo 20221117, 1.0.0, created based on edp12f_temp_hum.yml
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.0.1. added updates as parameter
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.1.0. moved to framework with !include statements
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.1.1. added esp version and wifi info text sensors to publish on web
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.2, renamed script to reflect sensors/switches and measures/manipulators
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.3, added $devices variable to name configuration deployed
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.4, moved i2c configuration to separate include file
# Pawelo 20221203, 1.1.5, added Restart button on web
