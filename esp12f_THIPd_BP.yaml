# Pawelo 20221117, 1.0.0, created based on edp12f_temp_hum.yml
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.0.1. added updates as parameter
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.1.0. moved to framework with !include statements
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.1.1. added esp version and wifi info text sensors to publish on web
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.2, renamed script to reflect sensors/switches and measures/manipulators
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.3, added $devices variable to name configutation deployed
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.4, moved i2c configuration to separate include file
# Pawelo 20221203, 1.1.5, added Restart button on web
