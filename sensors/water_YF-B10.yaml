#* Water usage sensors using YF-B10 valve configuration
#? DONE: calibrate sensor on water, based on https://community.home-assistant.io/t/using-esphome-to-build-a-water-flow-rate-meter/119380/75
#? DONE: CALIBRATION DONE: Looks like sensor measures  flow of 1.3L/min at minimum, so very slow move is not detected
# Pawelo, 20230111, created based on https://www.pieterbrinkman.com/2022/02/02/build-a-cheap-water-usage-sensor-using-esphome-home-assistant-and-a-proximity-sensor/
# Pawelo, 20230121, final configuration with real sensor
# Pawelo, 20231008, added to preserve total in global variable
# Pawelo, 20231017, added water_updates_interval for water sensors updates (much often than $updates)
# Pawelo, 20231017, added delta filter to prevent very frequent mqtt messages on every pulse
# Pawelo, 20231017, added water_flow_min_delta variable for water sensors updates (to have no publish on every pulse)
# Pawelo, 20250626, changed clamp min_value to -0.05 to allow for +/- small pressure changes to not be recorded as flow
