#* Temperature and Humidity sensor SHT30 configuration
# Pawelo, 20221119, created as my framework based on !include statements
# Pawelo, 20221127, extended accuracy decimals to 2
# Pawelo, 20230108, testing confirm the same config is ok for cable outdoor version of SHT30,
#                   wiring: BLACK - GND, RED - 3.3V, YELLOW = CLK/SCL, WHITE - SDA/SAA
# Pawelo, 20230111, added i2c bus identification
