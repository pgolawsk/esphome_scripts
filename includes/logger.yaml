#* Enable logging
# Pawelo, 20221119, created as my framework based on !include statements
# Pawelo, 20230728, added component as ERROR  to get rid of warning that sensor check should not be longer than 200-300ms
# Pawelo, 20230929, back to WARN log level, as seams 2023.9.1 resolved issue with sensor warnings taken too long to operate
# Pawelo, 20250103, excluded WARN(ING) from tcs34725 as it clutters logs too much
# Pawelo, 20250208, excluded INFO from weact_2.90_3c as it clutters logs too much
# Pawelo, 20251130, excluded INFO from sgp30 as it clutters logs too much
