# Pawelo 20221112, 1.0.0, created based on https://github.com/nygma2004/esphome
# Pawelo 20221114, 1.0.1, improved by adding secondary MQTT topic to each sensor (idea from https://community.home-assistant.io/t/publish-mqtt/324939)
# Pawelo 20221114, 1.0.3, added Material Design Icons for sensors, based on https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/2.0.46/
# Pawelo 20221114, 1.0.4, added prometheus setup, disabled OTA via web based on https://esphome.io/components/prometheus.html
# Pawelo 20221115, 1.0.5, switched wifi to not internal sensor to make it visible in prometheus
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.0.6. added updates as parameter
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.1.0. moved to framework with !include statements
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.1.1. added esp version and wifi info text sensors to publish on web
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.2, renamed script to reflect sensors/switches and measures/manipulators
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.3, added $devices variable to name configutation deployed
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.4, moved i2c configuration to separate include file
# Pawelo 20221203, 1.1.5, added Restart button on web
