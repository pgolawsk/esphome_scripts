#* ESP12F sensor board script name reflecting configuration esp12f_MMmm_SSss__PP.yaml
#* Please read README.md for details
#* For pinout see: file://.//pinouts/ESP_12E_pinout.png
# NOTE: pin 9 do not work (it hangs ESP)- reserved for flashing;
# NOTE: 10 - use with caution, read https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1462
# WARN: DO NOT ADD any more sensors as it will impact /metrics (prometheus) and in worst case brick the device

# Pawelo 20230115, 1.1.5, created, manipulator LED on https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=72272
# Pawelo 20230923, 1.1.5, added HA Connected binary sensor
# Pawelo, 20240902, refactoring: "status_led" renamed to "led"
# Pawelo, 20241124, include first OVERRIDEs and then BOARD itself
# Pawelo, 20241124, cleanup of old/unused mqtt commented code
# Pawelo, 20241124, added wifi strength sensor and wifi_scan button
# Pawelo, 20250103, added entity_category to LED
# Pawelo, 20250111, fix for /metrics by reducing no of components - disabled measurement LED and led_cycle
# Pawelo, 20250111, added LEDs as switches to avoid light as it brakes prometheus (/metrics) due to multiple rows for light
# Pawelo, 20250111, changed to use includes/board_esp8266.yaml with variables

# WARN: DO NOT ADD any more sensors as it will impact /metrics (prometheus) and in worst case brick the device
