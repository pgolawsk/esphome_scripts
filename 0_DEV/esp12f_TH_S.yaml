#* ESP12F sensor board script name reflecting configuration esp12f_MMmm_SSss__PP.yaml
#* Please read README.md for details
#* For pinout see: file://../pinouts/ESP_12E_pinout.png
# NOTE: pin 9 do not work (it hangs ESP)- reserved for flashing;
# NOTE: pin 10 - use with caution, read https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1462

# Pawelo 20221112, 1.0.0, created based on https://github.com/nygma2004/esphome
# Pawelo 20221114, 1.0.1, improved by adding secondary MQTT topic to each sensor (idea from https://community.home-assistant.io/t/publish-mqtt/324939)
# Pawelo 20221114, 1.0.3, added Material Design Icons for sensors, based on https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/2.0.46/
# Pawelo 20221114, 1.0.4, added prometheus setup, disabled OTA via web based on https://esphome.io/components/prometheus.html
# Pawelo 20221115, 1.0.5, switched wifi to not internal sensor to make it visible in prometheus
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.0.6. added updates as parameter
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.1.0. moved to framework with !include statements
# Pawelo 20221119, 1.1.1. added esp version and wifi info text sensors to publish on web
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.2, renamed script to reflect sensors/switches and measures/manipulators
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.3, added $devices variable to name configuration deployed
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.4, moved i2c configuration to separate include file
# Pawelo 20221203, 1.1.5, added Restart button on web
# Pawelo 20230923, 1.1.5, added HA Connected binary sensor
# Pawelo, 20250107, changed to use includes/board_esp8266.yaml with variables
# Pawelo, 20250202, moved to 0_DEV folder
