#* ESP12F sensor board script name reflecting configuration esp12f_MMmm_SSss__PP.yaml
#* Please read README.md for details
#* For pinout see: file://../pinouts/ESP_12E_pinout.png
# NOTE: pin 9 do not work (it hangs ESP)- reserved for flashing;
# NOTE: pin 10 - use with caution, read https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1462

# Pawelo 20230103, 1.1.5, created based on THI_SB.yaml
# Pawelo 20230923, 1.1.5, added HA Connected binary sensor
# Pawelo 20240628, 1.1.5, moved filters offset adjustments for SCD40 to variables
# Pawelo, 20250107, changed to use includes/board_esp8266.yaml with variables
# Pawelo, 20250202, moved to 0_DEV folder
