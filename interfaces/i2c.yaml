#* I2C interface on given GPIO pins
#! for AVT5713 GIPO5 is used by switch, do not use for I2C
# Pawelo, 20221127, created
# Pawelo, 20230121, add variables to configure the interface
#! pin 9 do not work (it hangs ESP)- reserved for flashing;
#! pin 10 - use with caution, read https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1462
# Pawelo, 20230728, set frequency to 400kHz (no effect) to get rid of warning that sensor check should not be longer than 200-300ms
