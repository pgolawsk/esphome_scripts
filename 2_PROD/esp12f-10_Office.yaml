#* ESP12F - Office device script
#* Please read README.md for details
#* For pinout see: file://../pinouts/ESP_12E_pinout.png
# NOTE: pin 9 do not work (it hangs ESP)- reserved for flashing;
# NOTE: pin 10 - use with caution, read https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1462
###
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.0.0, created based on esp12f_THL_SB.yml
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.2, renamed script to reflect sensors/switches and measures/manipulators
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.3, added $devices variable to nam configuration deployed
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.4, moved i2c configuration to separate include file
# Pawelo 20221203, 1.1.5, added Restart button on web
# Pawelo 20230923, 1.1.5, added HA Connected binary sensor
# Pawelo 20240628, 1.1.5, moved filters offset adjustments for SCD40 to variables
# Pawelo, 20240902, refactoring: "status_led" renamed to "led"
# Pawelo, 20250111, changed to use includes/board_esp8266.yaml with variables
# Pawelo, 20250202, renamed and moved to 1_UAT folder
# Pawelo, 20250221, added uptime_boot text sensor
# Pawelo, 20250413, re-flashed with latest esphome and tests with SCD40 and SGP30
# Pawelo, 20250413, changed LED as switch to avoid light as it brakes prometheus (/metrics) due to multiple rows for light
# Pawelo, 20250615, commented "B" relay and light as it is not used in this room
# Pawelo, 20250615, set temp offset for SCD40 to -11.5C and humidity offset to 18.0% as it was tested in this room
# Pawelo, 20250615, moved the script to 2_PROD
# Pawelo, 20250619, disabled eCO2 and TVOC sensor to fix prometheus /metrics endpoint
# Pawelo, 20250712, enabled version and uptime_boot text sensors
# Pawelo, 20250714, disabled uptime_boot text sensors
# Pawelo, 20250720, switch LED back to light type (resolved by custom components/prometheus)
# Pawelo, 20250808, set temp offset for SCD40 to -6.5C and humidity offset to 7.0% as compare between Office and Entrance sensors
# Pawelo, 20251122, enabled Factory Reset button, to clean up NVS if needed
# Pawelo, 20251122, enabled debug component and sensors, as prometheus /metrics endpoint is working fine now
# Pawelo, 20251122, enabled eCO2 and TVOC sensor back as prometheus /metrics endpoint is working fine now
