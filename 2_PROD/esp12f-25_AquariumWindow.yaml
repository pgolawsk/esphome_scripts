#* ESP12F - Aquarium Window device script
#* Please read README.md for details
#* For pinout see: file://../pinouts/ESP_12E_pinout.png
# NOTE: pin 9 do not work (it hangs ESP)- reserved for flashing;
# NOTE: 10 - use with caution, read https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1462
# WARN: DO NOT ADD any more sensors as it will impact /metrics (prometheus) and in worst case brick the device

# Pawelo 20230115, 1.1.5, created, manipulator LED on https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=72272
# Pawelo 20230923, 1.1.5, added HA Connected binary sensor
# Pawelo, 20240902, refactoring: "status_led" renamed to "led"
# Pawelo, 20241124, include first OVERRIDEs and then BOARD itself
# Pawelo, 20241124, cleanup of old/unused mqtt commented code
# Pawelo, 20241124, added wifi strength sensor and wifi_scan button
# Pawelo, 20250103, added entity_category to LED
# Pawelo, 20250111, fix for /metrics by reducing no of components - disabled measurement LED and led_cycle
# Pawelo, 20250111, added LEDs as switches to avoid light as it brakes prometheus (/metrics) due to multiple rows for light
# Pawelo, 20250111, changed to use includes/board_esp8266.yaml with variables
# Pawelo, 20250115, disabled wifi_strength to avoid cut prometheus (/metrics) in some rare cases
#! Pawelo, 20250125, confirmed to "RTTTL on mqtt" needs to be disabled as it makes OTA unstable
# Pawelo, 20250202, renamed and moved to 2_PROD folder
# Pawelo, 20250221, added uptime_boot text sensor (disabled)
# Pawelo, 20250418, disable color temperature sensor as it is not essential while prometheus output is cutting out
# Pawelo, 20250418, enabled boot and uptime sensors (maybe it will work with prometheus)
# Pawelo, 20250619, disabled text sensors, wifi_scan button, factory reset button to fix prometheus /metrics endpoint
# Pawelo, 20250712, enabled version and uptime_boot text sensors
# Pawelo, 20250713, disable uptime_boot text sensor to fix /metrics endpoint
# Pawelo, 20250720, switch LEDs back to light type (resolved by custom components/prometheus)
# Pawelo, 20250720, enabled RTTTL via MQTT
# Pawelo, 20251122, enabled Factory Reset button, to clean up NVS if needed
# Pawelo, 20251122, enabled debug component and sensors, as prometheus /metrics endpoint is working fine now
