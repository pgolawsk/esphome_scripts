#* ESP12F - Underfloor device script
#* Please read README.md for details
#* For pinout see: file://../pinouts/ESP_12E_pinout.png
# NOTE: pin 9 do not work (it hangs ESP)- reserved for flashing;
# NOTE: pin 10 - use with caution, read https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1462

# Pawelo, 20240902, refactoring: "status_led" renamed to "led"
# Pawelo, 20250103, added entity_category to LED
# Pawelo, 20250107, changed to use includes/board_esp8266.yaml with variables
# Pawelo, 20250202, renamed and moved to 2_PROD folder
# Pawelo, 20250208, added min_temp and max_temp properties to Dallas temperature sensors
# Pawelo, 20250208, added one_wire due to deprecated dallas interface
# Pawelo, 20250221, added uptime_boot text sensor (disabled)
# Pawelo, 20250221, changed Dallas NG to regular Dallas (via onewire)
# Pawelo, 20250619, disabled text sensors, wifi_scan button, factory reset button to fix prometheus /metrics endpoint
