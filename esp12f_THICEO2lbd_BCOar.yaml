#* ESP12F sensor board script name reflecting configuration esp12f_MMmm_SSss__PP.yaml
#* Please read README.md for details
#! pin 9 do not work (it hangs ESP)- reserved for flashing;
#! pin 10 - use with caution, read https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1462
###
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.0.0, created based on esp12f_THL_SB.yml
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.2, renamed script to reflect sensors/switches and measures/manipulators
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.3, added $devices variable to nam configutation deployed
# Pawelo 20221127, 1.1.4, moved i2c configuration to separate include file
# Pawelo 20221203, 1.1.5, added Restart button on web
# Pawelo 20230923, 1.1.5, added HA Connected binary sensor
